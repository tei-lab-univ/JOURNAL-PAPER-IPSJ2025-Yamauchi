  abstract = {This survey gives an overview of the current research on compositional algorithms for verification and synthesis of modular systems modelled as interacting finite-state machines. Compositional algorithms operate by repeatedly simplifying individual components of a large system, replacing them by smaller so-called abstractions, while preserving critical properties. In this way, the exponential growth of the state space can be limited, making it possible to analyse much bigger state spaces than possible by standard state space exploration. This paper gives an introduction to the principles underlying compositional methods, followed by a survey of algorithmic solutions from the recent literature that use compositional methods to analyse systems automatically. The focus is on applications in supervisory control of discrete event systems, particularly on methods that verify critical properties or synthesise controllable and nonblocking supervisors.},

We present a symbolic implementation of the learning algorithm, and incorporate it in the model checker NuSMV. Our experiments demonstrate significant savings in the computational requirements of symbolic model checking.",

  abstract="Algorithms for learning a minimal separating DFA of two disjoint regular languages have been proposed and adapted for different applications. One of the most important applications is learning minimal contextual assumptions in automated compositional verification. We propose in this paper an efficient learning algorithm, called , that learns and generates a minimal separating DFA. Our algorithm has a quadratic query complexity in the product of sizes of the minimal DFA's for the two input languages. In contrast, the most recent algorithm of Gupta et al. has an exponential query complexity in the sizes of the two DFA's. Moreover, experimental results show that our learning algorithm significantly outperforms all existing algorithms on randomly-generated example problems. We describe how our algorithm can be adapted for automated compositional verification. The adapted version is evaluated on the LTSA benchmarks and compared with other automated compositional verification approaches. The result shows that our algorithm surpasses others in 30 of 49 benchmark problems.",

  abstract="Compositional verification is a promising approach to addressing the state explosion problem associated with model checking. One compositional technique advocates proving properties of a system by checking properties of its components in an assume-guarantee style. However, the application of this technique is dificult because it involves non-trivial human input. This paper presents a novel framework for performing assume-guarantee reasoning in an incremental and fully automated fashion. To check a component against a property, our approach generates assumptions that the environment needs to satisfy for the property to hold. These assumptions are then discharged on the rest of the system. Assumptions are computed by a learning algorithm. They are initially approximate, but become gradually more precise by means of counterexamples obtained by model checking the component and its environment, alternately. This iterative process may at any stage conclude that the property is either true or false in the system. We have implemented our approach in the LTSA tool and applied it to a NASA system.",

In this paper, we show how to decompose a specification into components when either no such decomposition is given, or when the given composition does not lend itself to an efficient compositional verification. Our decomposition is the starting point for an application of the L* learning algorithm, generating assumptions for an assume-guarantee reasoning. We prove correctness of the decomposition as well as present experimental results using the model checker FDR2 as the teacher during learning.",

  abstract = {Finite-state verification techniques are often hampered by the stateexplosion problem. One proposed approach for addressing this problem is assume-guarantee reasoning. Using recent advances in assume-guarantee reasoning that automatically generate assumptions, we undertook a study to determine if assume-guarantee reasoning provides an advantage over monolithic verification. In this study, we considered all two-way decompositions for a set of systems and properties, using two different verifiers, FLAVERS and LTSA. By increasing the number of repeated tasks, we evaluated the decompositions as the systems were scaled. In only a few cases could assume-guarantee reasoning verify properties on larger systems than monolithic verification and, in these cases, assumeguarantee reasoning could only verify these properties on systems a few sizes larger than monolithic verification. This discouraging result, although preliminary, raises doubts about the usefulness of assume-guarantee reasoning.},

abstract = {We present a constraint-based approach to computing winning strategies in two-player graph games over the state space of infinite-state programs. Such games have numerous applications in program verification and synthesis, including the synthesis of infinite-state reactive programs and branching-time verification of infinite-state programs. Our method handles games with winning conditions given by safety, reachability, and general Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties. For each property class, we give a deductive proof rule that --- provided a symbolic representation of the game players --- describes a winning strategy for a particular player. Our rules are sound and relatively complete. We show that these rules can be automated by using an off-the-shelf Horn constraint solver that supports existential quantification in clause heads. The practical promise of the rules is demonstrated through several case studies, including a challenging "Cinderella-Stepmother game" that allows infinite alternation of discrete and continuous choices by two players, as well as examples derived from prior work on program repair and synthesis.},

  abstract="Goal-models (GM) have been used in adaptive systems engineering for their ability to capture the different ways to fulfill the requirements. Contextual GM (CGM) extend these models with the notion of context and context-dependent applicability of goals. In this paper, we observe that the interpretation of a goal achievement is itself context-dependent. Thus, we introduce the notion of Pragmatic Goals which have a dynamic satisfaction criteria. However, the specification of context-dependent goals' applicability as well as their interpretations make it hard for stakeholders to decide whether the model is achievable for all possible context combinations. Thus we also developed and evaluated an algorithm to decide on the Pragmatic CGM's achievability. We performed several experiments to evaluate our algorithm regarding correctness and performance and concluded that it can be used for deciding at runtime the tasks to execute under a given context to achieve a quality constraint as well as for pinpointing context sets in which the model is intrinsically unachievable.",

The existence problem for a supervisor is reduced to finding the largest controllable language contained in a given legal language. Two examples are provided.",

The focus here is on simple stochastic parity games, that is, two-player games with turn-based probabilistic transitions and $\omega$-regular objectives formalized as parity (Rabin chain) winning conditions. An efficient translation from simple stochastic parity games to nonstochastic parity games is given. As many algorithms are known for solving the latter, the translation yields efficient algorithms for computing the states of a simple stochastic parity game from which a player can win with probability 1.",

  abstract="We argue that the standard constraints on liveness conditions in nonblocking trace models---machine closure for closed systems, and receptiveness for open systems---are unnecessarily weak and complex, and that liveness should, instead, be specified by augmenting transition systems with acceptance conditions that satisfy a locality constraint. First, locality implies machine closure and receptiveness, and thus permits the composition and modular verification of live transition systems. Second, while machine closure and receptiveness are based on infinite games, locality is based on repeated finite games, and thus easier to check. Third, no expressive power is lost by the restriction to local liveness conditions. We illustrate the appeal of local liveness using the model of Fair Reactive Systems, a nonblocking trace model of communicating processes.",

  abstract="In our study of dynamic systems, our first goal is to obtain a model. For our purposes, a model consists of mathematical equations which describe the behavior of a system. For example, in Chap. 5 we developed the set of equations (5.7)--(5.12) which describe how the state of a DES evolves as a result of event occurrences over time. Our next goal is to use a model in order to obtain explicit mathematical expressions for quantities of interest. For example, in Chap. 7 our model was a Markov chain and the main quantities of interest were the state probabilities $\pi$j(k) = P[Xk= j], j = 0, 1, {\ldots} In some cases, we can indeed obtain such expressions, as we did with birth-death chains at steady state in Sect. 7.4.3. In general, however, ``real world'' systems either do not conform to some assumptions we make in order to simplify a model, or they are just too complex to yield analytical solutions. Our mathematical model may still be valid; the problem is that we often do not have the tools to solve the equations which make up such a model. Simulation is a process through which a system model is evaluated numerically, and the data from this process are used to estimate various quantities of interest. As we have repeatedly pointed out in previous chapters, analytical solutions for DES are particularly hard to come by, making simulation a very attractive tool for their study.",

  abstract = {Partial order reduction is a state space pruning approach that has been originally introduced in computer aided verification. Recently, various partial order reduction techniques have also been proposed for planning. Despite very similar underlying ideas, the relevant literature from computer aided verification has hardly been analyzed in the planning area so far, and it is unclear how these techniques are formally related. We provide an analysis of existing partial order reduction techniques and their relationships. We show that recently proposed approaches in planning are instances of general partial order reduction approaches from computer aided verification. Our analysis reveals a hierarchy of dominance relationships and shows that there is still room for improvement for partial order reduction techniques in planning. Overall, we provide a first step towards a better understanding and a unifying theory of partial order reduction techniques from different areas.},

NDP2 is provably correct, and fixes several problems with prior work. We also describe two preprocessing algorithms that can provide a restricted version of the symbolic abstraction capabilities of the well-known MBP planner. The preprocessing algorithms accomplish this by rewriting the planning problems, hence do not require any modifications to NDP2 or its classical planner. In our experimental comparisons of NDP2 (using FF as the classical planner) to MBP in six different planning domains, each planner outperformed the other in some domains but not others. Which planner did better depended on three things: the amount of nondeterminism in the planning domain, domain characteristics that affected how well the abstraction techniques worked, and whether the domain contained unsolvable states."

  abstract = "Planning in nondeterministic domains yields both conceptual and practical difficulties. From the conceptual point of view, different notions of planning problems can be devised: for instance, a plan might either guarantee goal achievement, or just have some chances of success. From the practical point of view, the problem is to devise algorithms that can effectively deal with large state spaces. In this paper, we tackle planning in nondeterministic domains by addressing conceptual and practical problems. We formally characterize different planning problems, where solutions have a chance of success (“weak planning”), are guaranteed to achieve the goal (“strong planning”), or achieve the goal with iterative trial-and-error strategies (“strong cyclic planning”). In strong cyclic planning, all the executions associated with the solution plan always have a possibility of terminating and, when they do, they are guaranteed to achieve the goal. We present planning algorithms for these problem classes, and prove that they are correct and complete. We implement the algorithms in the mbp planner by using symbolic model checking techniques. We show that our approach is practical with an extensive experimental evaluation: mbp compares positively with state-of-the-art planners, both in terms of expressiveness and in terms of performance."

  abstract="In many areas of computer science, we are given an unsatisfiable set of constraints with the goal to provide an insight into the unsatisfiability. One of common approaches is to identify minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of the constraint set. The more MUSes are identified, the better insight is obtained. However, since there can be up to exponentially many MUSes, their complete enumeration might be intractable. Therefore, we focus on algorithms that enumerate MUSes online, i.e. one by one, and thus can find at least some MUSes even in the intractable cases. Since MUSes find applications in different constraint domains and new applications still arise, there have been proposed several domain agnostic algorithms. Such algorithms can be applied in any constraint domain and thus theoretically serve as ready-to-use solutions for all the emerging applications. However, there are almost no domain agnostic tools, i.e. tools that both implement domain agnostic algorithms and can be easily extended to support any constraint domain. In this work, we close this gap by introducing a domain agnostic tool called MUST. Our tool outperforms other existing domain agnostic tools and moreover, it is even competitive to fully domain specific solutions.",
